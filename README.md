# Postcard-Creator
For the Konica Minolta Web Developer position exam, I chose to do the first project called Postcard Creator beacsue it is something different and unique and challening at the same time. In my school career, I did projects for user authentication and I did a project with Twitter but this seemed something that would require me to use mutiple languages and plugins and most importantly it seemed something different from everything that I ahve done in the past.
 
Postcard Creator is a web application that takes an image as an input (Upload image option) from the user, asks the user to crop the image and then sends the modified image via email to anyone.

This project was done with assistance from few tutuorials like:
